# Meet bitmark: The code that makes knowledge accessible.
bitmark is the #1 content-first, open-source standard for digitizing content. Use it, share it and help close the education gap in the world.
**Why bitmark?**
## Today there are thousands of different data formats for digital learning content - leading to lock-ins for all. To make knowledge available we need to have a common ground - that's bitmark.
## bitmark Hackathon 2024
We hosted the second **bitmark Hackathon** at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) office in Zurich and online from November 21-22, 2024, uniting participants from all over the world to address pressing interoperability challenges in digital education.
Under the motto **“Together for Interoperability”** , the event brought together **renowned learning content publishers** : , [Springer Nature](https://group.springernature.com/gp/group/about-us), [Hueber Verlag](https://www.hueber.de/), [KLV Westermann](https://www.westermanngruppe.de/en/profile), h[ep Verlag](https://www.hep-verlag.ch/verlag), and [Mein Bildungsraum](https://www.meinbildungsraum.de/en/), alongside EdTech organizations, developers, and EdTech enthusiasts who worked tirelessly over 24 hours to develop solutions that improve the seamless exchange of digital learning content, powered by the open bitmark standard.
[Register for the bitmark Hackathon 2025](https://www.bitmark-association.org/bitmarkhackathon)
## An Open Standard With Benefits
#### No lock-ins anymore
Being an open standard, bitmark is specifically structured and designed to facilitate seamless and effortless data exchange across learning platforms.
#### Interactive learning experiences
bitmark allows you to create unique learning opportunities. bitmark supports all kinds of interactive quizzes typically used for learning.
#### Content & Mobile First
Learning material is usually designed with the layout as the top priority. This can make it challenging to display the content on mobile phones. bitmark is strictly content-first and mobile-first making it better suited for modern learning requirements.
#### Produce once & publish everywhere
bitmark enables a "one-source strategy", meaning you can publish your once-produced content seamlessly on multiple channels, e.g. mobile apps, legacy e-learning systems, CMS and even paper.
#### One Code. Endless Opportunities
From static like PDF to interactive learning opportunities.
#### More Accessibility
As a standard bitmark increases the interoperability for the digital education world. This means that learning content can be easily exchanged between different platforms.
„To enable successful digital teaching, we need seamless data exchange between the different platforms, users and learning content providers. Open standards are the foundation for this. That's why we promote and support the Open Source Standard Initiative bitmark and its goal of establishing exactly this interoperability and open standards in EdTech ecosystems.“
— Uwe Erpel, Head of Engineering at Cornelsen Publishing House

## How bitmark works
bitmark lets you break down content into small independently effective knowledget nuggets (bits) to make them available on mobile devices individually as well as grouped into chapters to create conclusive books. That way content can be easily digitalized, widespread and made accessible for everyone.

  * ## "bitmark liberates knowledge that was previously locked in a single medium and lets users choose how they want to access it. We're happy to support the standard to bring knowledge to the format of digital interaction people love most: chat." Pascal Rosenberger, Co-Founder & CEO von Eggheads

— Uwe Erpel, Head of Engineering at Cornelsen Publishing Housebe
  * ## „I had the idea myself that a standard would be useful to leverage the learning content, make it accessible on other applications and build an ecosystem around it. And then we found bitmark and it was perfect. Open-source, rich, powerful format, owned by an association, not proprietary.“ 
Jan Rihak, CEO of Classtime
  * ## "bitmark offers a lot of opportunities, as it is open-source, mobile and content-first. With formats like SCORM of HTML we didn’t see the possibilities that we now have with bitmark.“
Malik Michelini, Customer Success Officer Get More Brain
  * ## „Other data formats mix content and layout. With bitmark we finally have a very well-documented, well-working content-first data format that is very easy to feed into our models.“
Samuel Portman, CEO & Co-Founder of Taskbase


Item 1 of 5
####  Content-First vs. Layout-First
Content is often created with the layout in mind first. This results in well-designed but "dumb" PDF's and makes displaying the content on mobile phones very difficult. That's why there is so much knowledge, but little of it is digitally accessible. That needs to change, don't you think?
This is why bitmark describes the meaning of the content, not what it looks like. Computers are so empowered to understand the learning material and make something useful of it: Provide individual learning paths, give the right feedback at the right time, and much more. Also, complex layout information is no longer required. Instead, the optimal display is enabled by the content's meta data. That's content-first.
