## Open learning content ready for you to use** _._**
The Open Taskpool is an open-source set of community-curated language-learning exercises based on texts and translations contributed by the global community.
The learning tasks are based on the content-first (mobile-first) open-source standard bitmark. The entire source code of the Open Taskpool is open source, hosted on a Github repository and can be called via a specified API.

  * Learn More 
The Open Taskpool consortium coordinates the vocabulary collection and ensures the quality check of the generated tasks. The semi-automatically generated pool of exercises reduces the excessive resource requirements of content creation for language learning. It also enables state-of-the-art AI technologies to drive the adaptive components of digital learning products ‚Äì e.g. personalized feedback, task recommendations, and student statistics.
The Open Taskpool is made possible thanks to the generous support and philanthropic investments from Gebert R√ºf Foundation and Stiftung Mercator Switzerland. As an open source project, bitmark invites new partners to contribute to the growth of the task pool and to continuously improve quality and automation. 


### The Open Taskpool is for you if you are ...
  * in EdTech 
Outpace your competition by using existing learning content, so you can focus on your business.
  * a Language Learning Publisher

#### 3. Enrich Your Content With AI-based Feedback
Our partner Taskbase developed a dedicated feedback API to score the tasks of the bitmark Taskpool and to enable automated personalized feedback for the supported task types.
The Taskbase Feedback Engine¬Æ provides formative feedback at scale to develop complex learning scenarios.

##  Good To Know
  * ####  How can I access the "Open Taskpool powered bitmark"? 
The Taskpool partner Taskbase developed two APIs on how to access the Taskpool exercises and the Taskbase feedback. The complete open-source documentation of the Taskpool is published on GitHub. 
Taskpool API: [https://taskpool.taskbase.com/redoc ](https://taskpool.taskbase.com/redoc%20)
Taskbase Feedback API for bitmark: [https://bitmark-api.taskbase.com/documentation ](https://bitmark-api.taskbase.com/documentation%20)

  * ####  What is the bitmark standard? 
bitmark is the world's only strictly content-first open-source standard for creating learning content. bitmark is used to describe interactive, content-first learning material. It is mainly used in the process of digitizing existing learning material and in the workflow of creating new digital, mobile text books. Thanks to its open source basis, bitmark is also suitable for use as an internal format and in authring workflows without any risk.
The core of bitmark is interoperability of learning content between platforms, content creators, content owners like publishers and developers. The development and dissemination of the bitmark standard is supported by the non-profit bitmark Association.
  * ####  What is the Taskbase Feedback Engine¬Æ? 
The Taskbase Feedback Engine¬Æ provides out-of-box automated personalized feedback for all task types of the Taskpool. The Vocabulary Chapter of Taskbase's Showroom exemplifies the personalized feedback that you can expect for the Taskpool exercises. Visit https://showroom.taskbase.com/
The philanthropic partners, Gebert R√ºf Foundation and Mercator Foundation Switzerland, cover the Taskbase Feedback Engine¬Æ licensing fees for deploying Ukrainian-German language learning applications. Eligible for license funding within a limited user and interaction cap are Taskpool partners, Swiss EdTech Collider members, or non-profit organizations.
